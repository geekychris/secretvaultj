# Secret Versioning Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive secret versioning capabilities in the Java Vault application. All tests are now passing (14/14).

## Features Implemented

### Core Versioning Functionality
- **Automatic Versioning**: Every secret update creates a new version while preserving the old ones
- **Version Retrieval**: Access any specific version or default to the latest version
- **Version Listing**: List all versions of a secret with metadata
- **Version Information**: Get summary information about version counts and ranges
- **Version Range Queries**: Retrieve a range of versions efficiently
- **Version Deletion**: Soft delete specific versions (marked as deleted, not physically removed)
- **Version Restoration**: Restore previously deleted versions

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema
- Enhanced the `Secret` entity with versioning fields:
  - `version` field with auto-increment per secret
  - `deleted` boolean flag for soft deletion
  - `deletedAt` timestamp for deletion tracking
  - Composite index on `(path, key, version)` for performance
  - Database constraints ensure version uniqueness per secret

#### Repository Layer
- Added 10+ new repository methods for version-specific operations:
  - `findByPathAndKeyAndVersion()` - Find specific version (non-deleted only)
  - `findByPathAndKeyAndVersionIncludingDeleted()` - Find any version for restoration
  - `findAllVersionsByPathAndKey()` - List all versions
  - `findVersionRangeByPathAndKey()` - Range queries
  - `countVersionsByPathAndKey()` - Version counts
  - `findMinVersionByPathAndKey()` / `findMaxVersionByPathAndKey()` - Version bounds

#### Service Layer
- Enhanced `SecretService` with 6 new versioning methods:
  - `listSecretVersions()` - List all versions with metadata
  - `getSecretVersionInfo()` - Get version summary information
  - `getSecretVersionRange()` - Retrieve version ranges
  - `deleteSecretVersion()` - Soft delete specific versions
  - `restoreSecretVersion()` - Restore deleted versions
  - Enhanced `getSecret()` to accept optional version parameter

#### REST API Endpoints
- Added 5 new versioning endpoints:
  - `GET /v1/secret/versions/{path}?key={key}` - List all versions
  - `GET /v1/secret/version-info/{path}?key={key}` - Get version info
  - `GET /v1/secret/version-range/{path}?key={key}&startVersion={start}&endVersion={end}` - Range query
  - `DELETE /v1/secret/version/{path}?key={key}&version={version}` - Delete version
  - `POST /v1/secret/restore-version/{path}?key={key}&version={version}` - Restore version
- Enhanced existing `GET /v1/secret/{path}?key={key}&version={version}` to support version parameter

#### DTOs and Response Models
- Created new DTOs:
  - `SecretVersionResponse` - Individual version information
  - `VersionInfoResponse` - Version summary statistics
- Enhanced existing responses to include version information

## Security and Authorization
- All versioning operations respect existing policy-based access control
- Version deletion requires `delete` permission
- Version restoration requires `update` permission
- Version reading requires `read` permission
- All operations validate JWT tokens and user permissions

## Comprehensive Testing

### Integration Tests
- Added extensive integration test suite covering:
  - Complete versioning workflow (create → update → list → delete → restore)
  - Specific version reading and validation
  - Version range queries with validation
  - Error cases (invalid ranges, non-existent versions)
  - Authorization checks (forbidden access without tokens)
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions

### Test Coverage
- All 14 integration tests passing
- Tests cover both successful operations and error scenarios
- Authentication and authorization thoroughly tested
- Version lifecycle completely validated

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Added comprehensive "Secret Versioning" section
- Documented all new API endpoints with examples
- Provided complete workflow examples
- Added troubleshooting and best practices

### HTTP Client File
- Enhanced `vault-api.http` with versioning examples
- Added complete versioning workflow demonstrations
- Provided ready-to-use API calls for testing

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Composite indexes on `(path, key, version)` and `(path, key, deleted)`
- Efficient queries that filter deleted versions appropriately
- Version range queries optimized with BETWEEN clauses

### Caching
- Integrated with existing Redis caching system
- Cache invalidation on version operations
- Separate cache keys for different versions

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints continue to work unchanged
- Default behavior (without version parameter) returns latest version
- Existing secrets automatically get version 1
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Key Technical Decisions

### Soft Deletion vs Hard Deletion
- Chose soft deletion (marking as deleted) over hard deletion
- Enables version restoration capability
- Maintains audit trail and data integrity
- Allows for data recovery scenarios

### Version Numbering
- Auto-increment integer versions starting from 1
- Simple and intuitive for users
- Efficient for database queries and indexing
- Predictable and sequential

### Repository Method Separation
- Separate methods for operations that include/exclude deleted versions
- Clear distinction between active and all versions
- Prevents accidental exposure of deleted data
- Enables restoration functionality

## Future Enhancements Possible
- Version retention policies (e.g., keep only last N versions)
- Version tagging/labeling capabilities
- Version diff/comparison functionality
- Bulk version operations
- Version export/import capabilities
- Version-based notification system

## Quality Assurance
- All code compiled successfully with Java 23
- Integration tests comprehensive and passing
- Logging integrated for audit trails
- Error handling robust with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Input validation comprehensive
- Security model maintained throughout

## Deployment Ready
The implementation is production-ready with:
- Comprehensive testing
- Security validation
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completeness
- Backward compatibility
- Error handling robustness
